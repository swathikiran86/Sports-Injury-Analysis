# Sports-Injury-Analysis

Question:
Predict the injuries based on the given data and identify the features most contributing the to the injuries?
 
 
About Dataset
The dataset contains 3 files with information about the players metrics, game workload and injuries with attributes like athlete ids, date, workload, metric (hip mobility, groin squeeze).

Dataset description
1. Metrics dataset: provides data of hip mobility and groin squeeze of 30 athletes recorded every day from 01/05/2016 to 30/04/2018.
2. Workload dataset: provides workload taken by each athlete on a game day.
3. Injuries dataset: provides the dates on which the athletes were injured during a game.


Exploratory Data Analysis - Taks
- Basic statistics on the data
